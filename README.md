# Small projects in Python #

This is a personal repository for learning python concepts through exercises.

The exercises were done in python with the jupyter tool, sometimes using the anaconda notebook, and sometimes using the visual studio code editor with the jupyter extension.


I hope this repository will be of help to you :D
